How to use
You can customize usernames by editing the usernames in discord_usernames.txt.
Run discordgenerator.exe and use normal mode if you are a beginner/inexperienced with proxies and theading. 

- Proxy support
If you want to use proxies, simply paste the proxies in config/proxies.txt. HTTP proxies are only supported as of now.
If you get a WebDriver error when using proxies, your proxies might be dead. Make sure your proxies are alive.

Threading mode
- Uses multiple chrome windows
- Only run this when you have proxies or else one of you Chrome windows will get rate limited.
- Do put more than 6 threads unless you think your PC can handle it. I recommend using 2-3 threads.

Normal mode
- This only uses one chrome window.
- To create another discord account, wait 1 minute to avoid being rate limited, or use a VPN.
